Makka-tul-Mukarmah is a one of my favorite place. It's great grand city of Saudi Arabia. Some people write its name Mecca And some Makkah. But I don't like to say or write like this. I think we have pronounce its name with respect, Like Makka-tul-Mukarmah. If someone lives there he called Makki.The surahs of the Quran that were revealed in Makka-tul-Mukarmah are called Makki also because these were revealed in Makka-tul-Mukarmah. It's total area is 1200 kmÂ². It's population is 2.042 million. There are many great and historical places. Like Baitullah, Footprints of Holy Prophet Ibrahim Alaihisslama, Zamzam water, Safa Marwah Mountains, Hajr-e Aswad, Mosque Alhram, Cave of Saur and Hira etc. These all are respectable for me. But I love Makka-tul-Mukarmah for a different reason. This is the born city of The Holy Prophet Hadrat Muhammad peace be upon him. The Holy Prophet Hadrat Muhammad peace be upon him has spent thirty-five years of his life in Makka-tul-Mukarmah. When Holy Prophet Hadrat Muhammad peace be upon him was leaving Makka-tuk-Mukarmah, that time He was crying,  He spoke to Makka-tul-Mukarmah, O Makkah, you are so dearer to me but your inhabitants do not let me to live there. Then, after a long time The Holy Prophet Hadrat Muhammad peace be upon him conquer to Makka-tul-Mukarmah with blessings of Allah taala.And now people love and respect this place. Millions of people performed Umrah and Hajj there. Hajj is an Islamic duty that is performed only here in the whole world.May Allah grant us visit To Makka-tul-Mukarmah and Madina-tul-Munawrah again and again. Ameen.
